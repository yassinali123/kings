     1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites 
        </h1>
        <br>
      <h3>Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image. 
 As soon as an image is created it has copyright 
and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. 
 Only the owner has the right to reproduce the  work,
 display the work in public and copy the work or 
sell copies of the work to other people.
There are trademarks too such as Coke and Pepsi
 that are protected by law from being used by other people or companies.
The only exception to copyright is if you use an image 
from public domains such as Google Images. 
It is a difficult area because not everyone has given their permission 
for their photographs or artwork to be reproduced.
Fair Use is when you use an image for educational or 
news reporting purposes or if you have transformed the image or 
only used part of it.
It is always best to ask the owner of 
the image if you are not sure for their permission.
I think it is better to use your own photographs where 
possible because then you know they are your own property.</h3>
